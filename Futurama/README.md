<b>Problem:</b>

An alien message was also found etched out on the spaceship as a remnant in the Galactic Palace. 
Can you see if you can figure out what is written on it? (Image File)

<b>Solution:</b>

Looking at the image, it is obvious that the symbols are actually some weird font.
I tried checking the metadata of the image and tried running all kinda weird stuff, but couldn't find anything suspicious.
So I just decided to google for symbol fonts and alien fonts and the type and I discovered that the font was called Futurama - the 
name of the problem!

After discovering the font it was easy to translate it to leet.

The flag was: "4l13n 570ry 3nd5 h3r3"
