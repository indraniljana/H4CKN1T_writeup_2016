<b>Problem:</b>

In the Galactic Palace, where the semi-intelligent beings have evolved enough and now they can use different types of computers. 
One of them has lost a key to log in to its personal computer. The flag to enter can be found here. (File)



<b>Solution:</b>

I opened the given Q4.class file in a text editor and found a suspicious looking leet string, which turned out to be the flag.
