<b>Problem:</b>

Our intelligence found this piece of code on a cupboard of a Mathematics professor: 121061041065038121111078039035085028082081009083.

As we all know, Mathematics professors love cryptography and loves to keep things as safe as possible. 
The only thing we know about this is that the cipherkey is 4nk2k16.
<br><br><br>
<b>Solution:</b>

This is just a XOR cipher, as is obvious from the name.
Deciphering using the given key gives a base64 encoded string, decoding which we get the key "1 l0v3 x0r"
