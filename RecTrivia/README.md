<b>Solution:</b>

Seriously. That's the question.

At first I thought it was an address on the contest site, but all attempts ended in 404 errors.
On googling the "usp=sharing" part, I realized it was a drive download link, with the drive portion removed.
I quickly added the missing part, and the final link turned out to be 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dBfpWYP92r8wQGGx5K7RQ6eEtH0eezojVXsjI1NRF9w/edit?usp=sharing

That link simply led to a google doc file, which had the flag "y0u n41l3d 17"
